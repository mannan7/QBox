The internet connection connects straight into our qbox, therefore it is assigned the external IP address. However, qbox connects to a router so it will most likely get an internal IP address and the router will get the external IP address. Even though the internal IP is a different IP address, it's on the same network and all devices connected will share the same external IP. However, each connected device will have a different IP address from any other internal device.
